They\'re talking about it. The comments are split between "he\'s insane" and "he\'s the only person in the Bastion Sea who would bother." Both of those are good for us. Also, the old Grimoire signal in the rock: I\'m still working on it. Whatever transmitted from this island did it a LONG time ago, and the encoding is unlike anything in the modern database. I need more time. But Captain, somebody built something here, once. Before Maren. Before the trading post. Before anyone alive remembers. This rock isn\'t as empty as it looks.',
