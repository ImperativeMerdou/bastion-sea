        'Delvessa\'s plan covers the entire table. Three layers of charts, intelligence overlays, patrol schedules annotated in her sharp Kolmari hand, supply chain diagrams with interdiction windows calculated to the hour. Kovesse\'s cracked Wardensea frequencies feed live data into a Grimoire tablet propped against a lantern. Vorreth\'s twenty years of institutional knowledge fill the margins in a handwriting so precise it looks machine-cut.',
        'It is the most thorough operational brief ever assembled against a Wardensea installation by a crew of six people on a single ship.',
        'You read the whole thing. Every page. Every note. You read standing up because the cabin ceiling is too low for your horns if you straighten. Your crew watches you.',

        '"Doctrine doesn\'t update itself," Vorreth says. The same words from the same man, but the voice is different now. Harder. Closer to the officer he used to be. "The gap is structural. Built into the rock. Ninety seconds at shift change, twice a day. Dawn and dusk."',
        '"Kovesse. Their comms?"',
        'Kovesse\'s whiskers flatten with satisfaction. Her tail curls around the leg of her chair. "Cracked. Primary cipher rotation and the secondary internal channel. I can read their fleet coordination, their supply orders, their officer dispatches. Captain--" She leans forward. The Rathai\'s eyes catch the Grimoire light and throw it back green. "I know what they\'re having for dinner."',
        '"Suulen. The approach?"',
        'The Morventhi sits cross-legged against the bulkhead, white hair loose, her dark eyes half-closed. She speaks without opening them. "Fourteen-minute window between patrol arcs at the western approach. I threaded it on the way in. I can thread it again. But a fleet is not a single hull. We will need three staggered insertions at four-minute intervals. One miscalculation and the entire western battery opens fire."',
        '"Dragghen."',
        '"I\'m here."',
        '"I know you\'re here. What do you think?"',
        'The Gorundai is sharpening Danzai\'s spikes. Slow, methodical strokes. The rasp of iron on whetstone fills the pauses between words. "I think six thousand is six thousand regardless of how clever the plan is. I think twelve capital warships is twelve capital warships. And I think you\'re going to do it anyway, so I\'d rather have a full belly when we start." He tests a spike with his thumb. Blood beads. "The spikes are ready. Are you feeding us first?"',

      paragraphs: [
        'It begins at dawn.',
        'Not because every plan starts at dawn. The subversion begins with a letter smuggled through the officer\'s mess at first light, the blockade begins with a hull silhouette on the convoy horizon, the assault begins with an Oni dropping from the bow of a ship into waist-deep water inside the western battery\'s blind arc. They all begin at dawn because Karyudon decided that the day the Southern Reach changes is a day that starts with the sun.',
        'The details depend on the door.',
        'If it\'s force: the ninety-second window opens at 0614. Suulen threads the approach corridor in twelve minutes flat, the ship\'s hull kissing the patrol arc boundary close enough to scrape paint. Kovesse kills the western battery\'s targeting communications fourteen seconds before the breach. Vorreth marks the positions of every gun emplacement from memory, calling corrections by distance and elevation without looking at a chart. Delvessa coordinates the allied vessels, the fishing fleet from Ghostlight, the smuggler cutters from Keldriss, the timber barges from Windrow reinforced with iron plating and crewed by quarriers who volunteered because an Oni dug their people out of a cliff. They pour through the gap you open. The first cannon shot goes wide. The second hits water. The third doesn\'t fire at all because by then you\'re on the battery wall with Danzai in both hands and the gunners are discovering that a spiked war club does not respect fortification doctrine.',
        'If it\'s subversion: Vorreth\'s letter reaches Commander Tessoth Brielle at 0620. She reads it in her quarters with the door locked and her sidearm on the desk. The letter contains three things: the Second Division\'s unauthorized force expansion orders, the supply manifests proving offensive stockpiling, and a personal note from a man she graduated the academy with twenty-two years ago. The note says: "Tess. Check your chain of command. Then check your conscience. I\'ll be at the western approach at noon. Bring the officers who still remember what the uniform means." She burns the letter. She loads her sidearm. At 0900, she convenes a closed session with four officers she trusts. By 1100, the fortress splits. Loyalists versus expansionists. The garrison tears itself apart from the inside, and by the time you walk through the western gate, half the guns are pointed inward.',
        'If it\'s the siege: the first convoy never arrives. Suulen plots the intercept at the narrowest point of the twelve-mile corridor, a bottleneck between the southern shoals where the escort cutters have to break formation to navigate the shallows. Kovesse broadcasts false supply confirmations on the cracked frequencies. The garrison doesn\'t know the convoy is gone until the quartermaster\'s inventory reports start showing shortfalls. Week one: reduced rations. Week two: ammunition conservation protocols. Week three: desertion. The fortress bleeds without a wound. When you finally approach the western gate under a flag of parley, the commanding officer meets you at the threshold with sunken cheeks and the look of a man who has been counting meals for twenty-one days.',
