        'Suulen adjusts course without being told. She leans into the wheel, her white hair whipping sideways in a horizontal sheet, and threads the ship through a gap in the windline that nobody else can see. Morventhi spatial sense. She reads the air the way other people read water.',

That\'s all it is, sheer grey rock rising three hundred feet out of the sea, battered white with salt and scored with horizontal grooves where centuries of wind have carved the stone like a woodworker\'s lathe. No beach. No harbor in the traditional sense. Just rock, wind, and the insane geometry of a settlement built into the cliff face itself.',
        'Buildings jut from the stone like barnacles on a hull. Timber-framed structures bolted directly into the rock, connected by covered walkways and rope bridges that swing in the gale. Windbreaks everywhere: stone walls, timber baffles, angled roofs designed not to keep rain out but to deflect a wind that never stops. Smoke from chimneys doesn\'t rise here. It shoots sideways and vanishes.',

        'The dock, if you can call it that, is a reinforced timber platform recessed into a carved alcove in the cliff face. The alcove blocks enough wind to keep the ship from being smashed against the rock, but "enough" is relative. Ropes creak. The hull groans. Suulen ties off with knots that look like they were invented by someone who expected the ocean to personally try to undo them.',
        'A receiving party waits on the platform. Four humans in heavy oilskin coats, hoods up, faces weathered to leather by years of wind exposure. They carry no weapons, but their stances say they don\'t need them. Working hands. Calloused, scarred, thick-fingered. Quarriers. Timber cutters. People who wrestle stone and wood for a living and consider the wind a coworker, not an enemy.',

        '"Coppervein. Underground. These bastards do it on a cliff face with THAT--" He gestures at the wind, which obligingly tries to rip the words from his mouth. "--trying to kill them every day. That\'s not mining. That\'s war."',

        'The path up the cliff is a series of switchback stairs carved directly into the stone, with timber railings bolted into the rock every ten feet. The railings aren\'t decorative. Without them, the wind would send you over the edge and into three hundred feet of open air before you had time to swear about it.',
        'You climb with Danzai on your back. Your horns catch the wind like sails. The forward curve channels the gale around your skull in a way that\'s technically aerodynamic and practically annoying. Every few steps, a gust hits hard enough to make even you plant your feet and wait.',
        'The settlement unfolds as you climb. Windrow isn\'t a village. It\'s an engineering project. Every structure serves a purpose. Timber-frame houses with angled walls that split the wind around them. Rope-and-pulley systems for moving cargo between levels because carrying anything up these stairs in this gale is a death wish. Rain cisterns built into the rock, sealed against evaporation. A smithy carved into a deep alcove where the forge fire can actually stay lit.',
        'No ornament. No paint. No wasted material. These people build to survive, not to impress.',
        'Dragghen notices it all. His eyes move from the timber joints, pegged, not nailed, because nails work loose in vibrating rock, to the windbreak walls, to the drainage channels carved with geometric precision. "This is Coppervein engineering," he murmurs. "Not the same tradition, but the same thinking. Build for the environment, not against it. Work with the stone."',
