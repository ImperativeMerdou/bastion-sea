Coral ridges break the surface like the spine of something enormous and buried. The channels between them fork, double back, dead-end. The water is glass-still and dangerously shallow.',

The smell is brine and cured fish and woodsmoke.',

You can see maybe two hundred from the approach: fishers on the walkways, children running between stilt-houses, old women mending nets with hands that haven\'t stopped moving in sixty years. They watch your ship come through the channel with the flat expression of people who don\'t get visitors and prefer it that way.',

A blue that lives, that pulses with the rhythm of the tide, brightening and dimming like breathing. It spreads through the branching antler coral first, racing along the white limbs until they burn electric against the dark water. Then the brain coral answers in green, deep emerald shifting to jade, the ridged surfaces tracing patterns that look almost like writing.',
        'The plate coral goes purple. Violet and amethyst, layered in discs that fan out beneath the surface. Where the colors meet, blue against green, green against purple, the water itself seems to glow, the light diffusing through the glass-clear surface until the boundaries between coral, sea, and sky dissolve.',
