        'The stink hits first. Sulphur and hot iron, thick enough to coat your tongue, carried on a wind that tastes like the sea is being melted down for scrap. Three miles out and you\'re already breathing through your teeth.',
        'Anvil Cay sits on the horizon like a bruise. Dark stone wreathed in volcanic smoke. The sky above it burns orange where it should be blue, and the water around the approach is warm. Not comfortable-warm. Wrong-warm.',
        'This is not a trading post. This is not a fishing village with delusions of importance. This is a military installation built on a volcano, and it looks exactly as welcoming as that sounds.',
        'The harbor is a carved crescent of reinforced basalt. Three warships sit at anchor, real warships, iron-reinforced hulls and cannon decks, not the converted merchant vessels that pass for naval power in the outer islands. A fourth ship is in dry dock, half its hull stripped for repair. Signal flags snap from every mast in a language you don\'t read.',
        'Vorreth reads it for you. He hasn\'t blinked in two minutes.',
        '"Conqueror standard deployment," he says. The military voice. The one that strips everything human out of the words and leaves only information. "Three patrol vessels on rotating picket. Eight-hour shifts. Overlapping coverage arcs. The signal flags are fleet coordination: bearing reports, watch schedules, threat assessment."',

And these aren\'t Wardensea garrison troops." He pauses. "Conqueror marines are trained to take ground, not hold it. If we hit them, they counterattack. Hard. Fast."',

They\'re building one. Warship hulls in various stages of completion. Stockpiles of iron, timber, pitch, and sailcloth in the underground stores.
