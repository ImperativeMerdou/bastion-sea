        'The crew scatters into the celebration the way they always do, each finding their own version of victory. Dragghen commandeered the Consortium\'s kitchen forty minutes ago and hasn\'t been seen since, though the smell drifting up through the building suggests he\'s found the spice cabinet and declared war on it. Kovesse is broadcasting from the signing hall, replaying highlights, narrating the conquest for viewers who can\'t believe what they\'re watching. "NO SWORDS," she keeps saying into the feed. "NOT A SINGLE SWORD. She did this with MATH." Vorreth has already pulled the Consortium\'s security chief into a corner and is reviewing defensive protocols with the quiet intensity of a man who won\'t sleep until the perimeter is secured. And Suulen... Suulen has disappeared into the island\'s canal network to map the trade routes firsthand, because Suulen doesn\'t celebrate, she prepares.',
        'You find the rooftop by following the stairs past the last landing. The Consortium\'s main building is four stories, the tallest structure on the island, and from the top you can see the harbor, the warehouses, the residential quarter, the vineyards on the eastern slope. All of it organized. All of it productive. All of it, as of tonight, flying under your flag.',
