She doesn\'t waste things. She doesn\'t leave messes. The fact that the cups are still there means she hasn\'t looked up from her work in hours.',
        'The documents spread across the table look like a war room. Charts of trade flows. Shipping manifests with annotations in three colors of ink. Consortium bylaws, all forty-seven pages, with sections circled, cross-referenced, and annotated with margin notes so dense they\'ve become their own document.',

        '"The Consortium files quarterly earnings reports with the Kolmari Trade Office. Publicly available. I\'ve been reading them for three years." She finally looks up. Her glasses catch the lamplight. "The Sorrens are over-leveraged on warehouse contracts that expire in nine days. The Veshtari shipping fleet is running at sixty-three percent capacity because they lost two routes to Wardensea tariffs last quarter. And the Duvals--" She almost smiles. Almost. "The Duvals are sitting on a surplus of trade goods they can\'t move because Kolmari intermediary fees are eating their margins alive."',
        '"In words I understand?"',
        '"They\'re bleeding. All three families. Slowly, quietly, and they\'re too proud to admit it to each other." Now she does smile. "The Consortium isn\'t a government, Captain. It\'s a business. And businesses can be acquired."',
        'Dragghen leans against the doorframe, arms crossed. "Are we buying an island? Because I don\'t think we can afford an island."',
        '"We\'re not buying it." Delvessa straightens the documents into a stack with mechanical precision. "I\'m going to convince an island that being bought is in its best interest."',

        '"We\'re not infiltrating, Suulen. We have an appointment."',

The table is ironwood, long enough to seat thirty, and the three families have arranged themselves on the far side like a tribunal. The Sorrens on the left. The Veshtari in the center. The Duvals on the right.',
        'Matriarch Sorren is sixty-two and looks like she was carved from the same marble as her floors. Elder Veshtari is younger, forty-five, broad-shouldered, with the weathered hands of a man who built a shipping empire from a single fishing boat. Consul Duval is the oldest, seventy, thin as wire, with eyes that have been counting coins since before you were born.',
        'They look at you. Seven feet of Oni in a room designed for people who solve problems with paper. Your horns nearly brush the chandelier. The Danzai leans against your chair because there\'s no weapon rack in a conference room. There has never needed to be one.',
        'Until now.',
        '"Thank you for receiving us," Delvessa begins. She\'s standing. She doesn\'t sit when she works. You\'ve learned this about her. "I\'ll be direct. Captain Karyudon\'s territory now encompasses the Northern Arc and is expanding into the Central Belt. We control Tavven Shoal\'s harbor, Keldriss\'s intelligence network, Durrek\'s military infrastructure, Coppervein\'s ore supply, and Mossbreak\'s fleet operations."',
        'She lets the list settle. Three families doing math in their heads.',
        '"The Kolmari Pact has offered Sorren\'s Flat trade protection for the past eleven years. In that time, your intermediary fees have increased by forty-one percent. Your net margins have decreased by seventeen. The Wardensea patrols you rely on for shipping security have been reduced twice in the last three years due to, and I quote from their own budget reports, \'resource reallocation to priority sectors.\'" She adjusts her glasses. "You are not a priority sector."',
        'Consul Duval\'s pen stops moving.',
        '"What Captain Karyudon offers is something the Kolmari cannot: independence. Trade access to the Northern Arc and the Central Belt without intermediary fees. Shipping protection through waters we control. And, most critically, a partner who has no interest in taking a percentage of your profits." She pauses. "We want a flat tribute and preferred trade terms. Not a margin. The difference, over a fiscal year, is substantial."',
        'She opens a leather folio and places three documents on the table. One for each family. Personalized. Different terms. Different incentives.',

Delvessa concedes two minor route exclusivities and gains preferred docking rates at every Veshtari-controlled port in the Central Belt. When Veshtari shakes her hand, he\'s smiling. He thinks he won.',
        'He didn\'t.',
        'The Duvals are the hardest. Consul Duval is old, careful, and has survived three attempted hostile takeovers by Kolmari interests. He doesn\'t trust anyone. He reads every clause. He questions every projection. He asks Delvessa about depreciation schedules and amortization timelines and she answers without hesitation, without notes, without blinking.',

Coercion makes people do what you want. Persuasion makes people want what you\'re offering." She almost smiles. "The Kolmari taught me coercion. I taught myself the rest."',
