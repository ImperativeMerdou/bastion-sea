        'A flat shelf of sun-bleached rock jutting from the southern sea like a bald scalp breaking the waterline. No elevation to speak of: the highest point is maybe thirty feet above the tide mark, a gentle rise of white stone worn smooth by centuries of salt wind and merciless sunlight. No trees. No shade. No color except the blinding white of bleached coral and the shimmering haze of heat that turns the air above the rock into a liquid thing, rippling and distorting.',
        'A handful of structures cling to the rock. Five buildings, and the word "building" is doing heavy lifting. Sun-warped timber frames. Roofs of woven palm and salt-stiffened canvas. A dock that extends into the water on stilts so weathered they look like they\'re held together by stubbornness and the memory of nails.',
        'The heat hits like a forge door opening. You step off the gangplank and the sun lands on you with physical weight, pressing down on your horns, your shoulders. Your skin drinks it in. Esmer complexion built for heat, but even you narrow your amber eyes against the glare bouncing off every surface.',

A counter made from a ship\'s door laid across two barrels. Shelves lined with the essentials of survival in the southern sea: water casks, dried fish wrapped in salt paper, navigation charts drawn on hide, a few bottles of something amber that might be liquor or might be lamp oil and the distinction probably doesn\'t matter out here.',

Sixty-five, maybe seventy, with skin like cured leather and hands that move with the economy of someone who hasn\'t wasted a motion in decades. Sun-white hair cropped short against the heat. Eyes the color of the bleached rock outside: pale, washed out, but sharp. Sharp in the way that things get when they\'ve been staring at the same horizon for thirty years and have learned to spot a sail at twelve miles.',
        'Maren. She doesn\'t offer the name. It\'s painted on a plank above the door in letters so sun-faded you have to squint to read them. MAREN\'S. Just that. No "Trading Post" or "General Goods." The sign says who she is. If that\'s not enough, you can keep sailing.',
        'She looks at you. All the way up. Past the boots, the frame, the horns, the war club. Her expression doesn\'t change. This woman has been sitting on a rock in the middle of nowhere for three decades and has seen every kind of person the Bastion Sea can produce walk through her door.

Directly, mathematically, perfectly overhead, as if the island exists at the exact point in the world where the sun decides to look straight down for half an hour and forget that angles exist.',

Everything looks like a painting, two-dimensional, rendered in pure light without the contrast that tells your brain how far away things are.
