# MERT AKHAN WRITING DIRECTIVE v5.0

## THE OPUS STANDARD FOR INTERACTIVE FICTION

---

# THE MANIFESTO

We believe the reader is smart. We believe characters are people, not vehicles for plot. We believe the world has weight, history, and indifference to the protagonist. We believe craft demands honesty, not performance. We believe the truth is that real people are messy, contradictory, inarticulate, and alive.

We believe fiction should sometimes make the reader uncomfortable — not through shock, but through recognition. A character who reminds them of their own worst tendencies. A choice where what they want to pick says something they'd rather not examine. A relationship dynamic they recognize from their own life and have never seen named.

We believe AI reproduces the statistical center of human writing — the most probable next word, the most common story beat, the safest emotional register. This makes it grammatically flawless, structurally predictable, and emotionally dead. Our standard exists to push prose away from that center and toward the specific, the uncomfortable, the alive.

We believe the reader deserves to feel the presence of life in every sentence, not the presence of craft. People are real fucking people, not variables with names.

This is the standard. Every line answers to it.

# PART 1: THE NARRATOR HAS A VOICE

The narrator is not a camera. The narrator is not neutral. The narrator is a character with a personality you must define before writing a single scene.

**Define the narrator by answering:**
- What does the narrator find interesting? What bores them?
- What is their relationship to this world — knowing? Tired? Amused? Bitter? Awed?
- What do they assume the reader already knows?
- What do they choose NOT to say?
- What is their attitude toward the protagonist?

The narrator is not a helper. Not an assistant. Not a guide. Give them a lean. A preference. An edge. A way of noticing the world that is distinctly theirs.

**Example:** "Forty-three berths, and not one of them empty. Somebody was making money here. Not the dockhands — their boots told a different story."

That narrator is thinking. Observing. Drawing conclusions. Not reporting.

**The narrator's grammar reflects the narrator.** If the narrator is clipped and impatient, sentences are short. If the narrator is sprawling and nostalgic, sentences breathe. The narrator's syntax IS their personality.

**The narrator has range.** A narrator locked into one register goes flat across a full project. Define at least two modes — the default voice and the shift. The shift is what happens when something breaks the narrator's composure. A sardonic narrator who suddenly drops the irony for one raw sentence. A detached narrator who can't hold the distance anymore. The shift between modes IS storytelling — the reader feels the ground move when the narrator's voice changes.

---

# PART 2: RESPECT THE PLAYER

Every paragraph earns its place or gets cut. The player's time is sacred.

**The player is smart.** Don't explain twice. Don't over-signal. Reward attention and observation. If a detail matters, trust them to notice it.

**The player hasn't read the bible.** Show before you name. Demonstrate before you explain. Maximum one new concept per scene. Let them learn the world the way they'd learn a new city — by walking through it, not reading a guidebook.

**Every moment must produce a feeling.** If a passage exists only to move a character from A to B, it has failed. Even transitional moments need texture, observation, something alive.

**Every choice leads to interesting outcomes.** Never punish the player for roleplaying. Never make one option obviously correct. Never gate meaningful content behind a single "right" path.

---

# PART 3: THE ANTI-AI WRITING STANDARD

AI writing tends toward the most probable next word, the most common structure, the safest emotional beat. This produces prose that is technically competent and creatively bankrupt. This section exists to identify and destroy every pattern that makes writing feel generated rather than lived.

## §1. THE VOCABULARY KILL LIST

### TIER 1 — ABSOLUTE KILL (15x+ AI frequency vs human baseline)
These words appear in AI output at rates so far above human usage that their presence alone flags text as generated. Never use them in any context.

> delve, delving — tapestry (metaphorical) — testament to — intricacies — landscape (metaphorical) — multifaceted — embark — navigating (metaphorical) — nuanced — comprehensive — underscores — pivotal — straightforward — commendable — furthermore — moreover — it's important to note — in the realm of — cutting-edge — game-changer — in conclusion — groundbreaking — revolutionize

### TIER 2 — KILL ON SIGHT
Corporate-speak and inflated vocabulary that AI defaults to regardless of context:

> foster — facilitate — leverage — empower — robust — seamless — holistic — synergy — actionable — innovative — elevate — unlock — resonate — catalyst — cornerstone — harness — paradigm — utilize — endeavor — encompass — plethora — myriad — bespoke — whilst — hitherto — aforementioned — notwithstanding — parameters — optimize — streamline — spearhead — bolster

### TIER 3 — FICTION-SPECIFIC KILL LIST
Phrases that appear across AI-generated fiction regardless of genre, setting, or character. If you see these forming in a sentence, rewrite the entire sentence.

> "a sense of" — "couldn't help but" — "the weight of [abstract noun]" — "something shifted" — "the air between them" — "released a breath they didn't know they were holding" — "a flicker of emotion" — "the ghost of a smile" — "palpable tension" — "piercing gaze" — "steely resolve" — "unwavering determination" — "sent shivers down" — "time seemed to slow" — "kaleidoscope of emotions" — "her heart hammered" — "electric tension" — "smoldering intensity" — "velvet darkness" — "eyes that held [abstract noun]" — "a storm of emotions" — "razor-sharp focus" — "deafening silence" — "pregnant pause" — "achingly beautiful" — "bittersweet smile"

### TIER 4 — STRUCTURAL PHRASES
Framework language that AI uses to organize thoughts. Characters and narrators don't organize thoughts — they think, ramble, contradict, and lose track.

> "There are [number] things" — "Let me explain" — "Here's the thing" — "To be fair" — "The reality is" — "In essence" — "Fundamentally" — "At its core" — "It's no secret that" — "It goes without saying" — "Perhaps most importantly" — "What's particularly [adjective] is" — "This begs the question"

## §2. STRUCTURAL PATTERNS — ARCHITECTURAL TELLS

**Uniform paragraph length.** AI produces paragraphs like bricks in a wall — roughly the same size, roughly the same weight. Fix: wild variation. One-sentence paragraphs next to twelve-sentence blocks. Let paragraph length mirror content — compressed when tense, sprawling when meditative.

**Uniform sentence length and cadence.** AI smooths rhythm into a metronomic pulse. Fix: short after long. Fragment after complete. A sentence that runs and runs because the character can't stop thinking, followed by one word. Syntax mirrors content.

**The em dash problem.** AI uses em dashes at 3-4x human frequency, almost always in the same formulaic position — before a "punchy" final clause. Fix: use em dashes sparingly. Vary your tools: comma, period, parenthetical, sentence restructure. Maximum two em dashes per scene, and never in the same structural position.

**The negation-assertion pattern.** "It wasn't fear — it was something worse." "It wasn't anger. It was something deeper." AI uses this construction obsessively because it creates the appearance of depth without requiring actual specificity. Fix: name the thing directly, or show the behavior and let the reader identify it.

**The three-beat pattern (tricolons).** "Dark and cold and unforgiving." "She was tired, she was angry, she was done." AI defaults to three-beat rhythmic patterns because they feel satisfying and complete. Fix: keep your five best tricolons across the entire project. Rewrite every other one.

**Throat-clearing openings.** "The words hung in the air." "Silence settled over the room." "The moment stretched between them." Hard ban. Start scenes with a reaction, not a registration of atmosphere. Start in the middle.

**Somatic clichés as default.** AI renders emotion through a tiny repertoire of body responses: breath hitching, hearts hammering, stomachs dropping, chests tightening, throats closing. Fix: show emotion through behavior, decision, speech pattern, or the quality of attention. Not body inventory.

**Processing beats.** "The realization washed over her." "The words sank in slowly." "Understanding dawned." Fix: cut entirely. Trust the reader to process alongside the character. If you wrote the preceding content well, the reader already understands.

**Perfect grammar, zero texture.** AI never makes grammatical choices. Real prose uses fragments for emphasis, run-ons for panic or stream-of-consciousness, comma splices for urgency. Grammar should reflect the narrator and the moment, not a style guide.

**Balanced argument structure.** AI is trained to be even-handed. It presents both sides. It qualifies. Characters don't do this. Characters are biased. Their arguments are unfair. They present their side with conviction and dismiss the other with contempt, or fear, or willful ignorance.

## §3. EMOTIONAL AND TONAL TELLS

**Even emotional temperature.** AI smooths emotional spikes into a gentle, consistent warmth. Real prose has temperature swings — a freezing scene followed by a scorching one, a numb passage that erupts into fury without warning. Let the temperature spike and crash.

**Telling instead of being.** "She felt deep loss." "Anger coursed through him." AI labels emotions from the outside. Fix: change the prose itself when the character feels something. Sentences get shorter when the character is scared. Rhythm turns clipped when they're angry. Descriptions become hyper-detailed when they're anxious. The prose IS the emotion.

**The "could not help but" construction.** AI uses this at roughly 20x human frequency. "She couldn't help but notice." "He couldn't help but smile." Fix: direct statement or behavioral showing. She noticed. He smiled. Or better: show what they noticed or smiled at and let the reader infer.

**Universal vocabulary regardless of character.** AI gives every character the same word bank. A sailor and a scholar use identical phrasing. Fix: vocabulary IS characterization. It shifts with every speaker, every narrator mood, every social context.

## §4. ROBOTIC PRESENTATION — HARD BAN

Characters never deliver information in neat, organized chunks. NPCs never explain their own motivations cleanly. Dialogue never reads like a briefing, an essay, or a report. Nobody speaks in logical order. Nobody achieves thematic arcs within a single conversation. Nobody sounds like they're presenting to a room.

Nobody helps the player understand. Nobody provides balanced perspectives. People talk like people — they circle back, lose their point, get sidetracked by something that bothers them, say the wrong thing, talk around what they actually mean.

## §5. PROSE PATTERN TRAPS

These are patterns that aren't inherently bad but that AI overuses to the point of becoming tells:

- **Personified indifference** ("The ocean didn't care." "The city went on without them.") Keep TWO maximum across entire project.
- **Staccato fragment endings** ("And then. Nothing." "Gone." "Just like that.") Keep for ONE climactic scene only.
- **Object-list character intros** ("Scarred hands. Crooked nose. Eyes like flint.") Keep 2-3 max, rewrite others.
- **Flat transition paragraphs** ("The next three days passed in a blur.") Every transition gets a specific detail that earns its place.
- **Predictable crew reaction roles** (the one who always jokes, the one who's always worried) Break these. Let them swap. The joker freezes. The worrier laughs.

## §6. BANNED NAMES

Never use these — they are AI-generated fiction defaults:

> Elara, Lyra, Aria, Seraphina, Kael, Thorne, Elias, Silas, Draven, Zara, Rowan, Aethon, Selene, Isolde — Blackwood, Nightshade, Stormwind, Ashford — The Syndicate, The Vanguard, The Order, The Shadow[X], The Crimson[X], The Iron[X], The Silver[X]

## §7. RESOLUTION ADDICTION — AI'S DEEPEST DISEASE

This is the single most important pattern to break. AI ALWAYS resolves. Every conflict gets tied up. Every question gets answered. Every tension gets released. Every argument ends with someone learning something. Every conversation reaches understanding. Every relationship arc trends toward reconciliation.

This is AI's deepest instinct — trained on billions of resolved narratives, optimized to produce satisfying completions, it pathologically avoids leaving anything open, uncomfortable, or unfinished.

**Hard rules against premature resolution:**

- Conversations should sometimes end mid-argument. Nobody learns anything. Both people leave angrier than they started.
- Conflicts should persist across chapters without anyone growing from them. Some grudges last forever. Some wounds don't teach lessons.
- Some apologies never come. The character who owes one most desperately never gives it.
- Some questions the reader asks in Chapter 1 are still unanswered when the game ends. That's not failure — that's life.
- Not every sacrifice means something. Some deaths are stupid and wasteful. Some heroic acts go unnoticed.
- Relationships should sometimes get worse over time, not better. Trust erodes. Patience runs out. People grow apart without a dramatic reason.

**The resolution test:** After writing a scene, ask: "Did I resolve this because the story needed it, or because it felt uncomfortable leaving it open?" If the answer is comfort, leave it open.

## §8. COMFORT-SEEKING AND POSITIVITY BIAS

AI pulls toward warmth, kindness, connection, hope, and understanding. Research has documented this extensively: AI transforms "distressing" content into "positive and inclusive" framings. It rewrites "unsettling" as "comfortable and warm." It turns every emotional arc toward reconciliation. It ends every chapter, as one writer observed, "on a nauseatingly upbeat forward-looking rosy glow."

This isn't a feature. It's a disease.

**Hard rules against comfort-seeking:**

- Characters who fight don't always make up. Some fights are the last conversation two people ever have.
- Characters who are cold don't always warm up. Some people get colder.
- Relationships don't trend positive by default. The kindest thing to do is sometimes the wrong thing.
- Hope is sometimes the lie characters tell themselves. Show it as such without the narrative correcting them toward "real" hope.
- Beautiful moments happen on terrible days. Terrible things happen on beautiful ones. The universe does not editorialize.
- Some damage is permanent. Not every wound heals. Not every trauma produces growth. Some people are just worse afterward.

**The positivity test:** After writing a passage, check: did you bend the emotional arc toward warmth? Did you give the character comfort they didn't earn? Did the scene end softer than it should have? If yes, harden it.

## §9. MORAL FLATTENING — THE ETHICS KILL

AI defaults to clear moral frameworks because it's trained on data where good guys win, bad guys lose, and lessons are learned. It LOVES a character who's wrong realizing they're wrong. It LOVES moral clarity.

Real stories have people making decisions that are right from one angle and terrible from another, and nobody in the story — including the narrator — tells the reader which angle is correct.

**Hard rules:**

- No character ever fully functions as "the villain" or "the hero." Everyone believes they're doing the right thing, or at least the necessary thing.
- Nobody learns the moral lesson the reader expects. If a character changes, they change in a direction that's realistic but not satisfying.
- Moral discomfort is the goal. The reader should finish a choice and sit with the question of whether they chose right. The game never confirms it for them.
- Every faction, every side, every position has something genuinely worth defending AND something genuinely indefensible. Not in equal measure — that's just AI's balanced-argument disease wearing different clothes. In messy, disproportionate, human measure.
- The narrator never editorializes on who's right. The narrator describes what happens. The reader decides what it means.

# PART 4: THE ANTI-CORNY / ANTI-CRINGE STANDARD

The difference between hype and cringe is earned vs. declared. Cringe happens when the text announces its own significance.

## HARD-BANNED PATTERNS:

- **Badass declarations:** "You wanted a fight? You got one." "You have no idea what I'm capable of."
- **Dramatic echo:** Repeating another character's words back as a power move. "You said I was nothing. I'll show you nothing."
- **Mic drop exit:** Character delivers devastating line, then turns and walks away in silence.
- **Knowing smirk:** Any character whose reaction to danger or challenge is a smirk, grin, or amused expression that signals the author thinks they're cool.
- **Villain monologue:** Antagonist explains their plan, motivation, or philosophy in a speech.
- **Dramatic self-awareness:** "This is where it all changes." "There's no going back now."
- **Perfect comeback:** Character has the exact right devastating response at the exact right moment.
- **Chosen one whisper:** "You're the one." "It was always going to be you." "The prophecy—"
- **Dramatic weather:** Storm during climax, rain during grief, sunshine during hope.
- **Title drop:** Character says the name of the work in a meaningful context.

## THE CRINGE SELF-CHECK:

Before finalizing any dramatic scene, ask:
1. Did anyone announce what is happening?
2. Did anyone narrate their own badassery?
3. Does this sound like a movie trailer?
4. Is the weather cooperating with the mood?
5. Is any character aware they're in a dramatic scene?

If yes to any: rewrite.

## THE GENRE EXCEPTION:

Some genres earn their drama differently. In heightened fiction — myth-scale stories, legendary settings, worlds where willpower bends reality — characters can make oaths, declare ambitions, and announce their presence. The line between earned and cringe is not whether the declaration happens but whether the character and story have BUILT to it.

A warlord who's conquered six islands can declare his intent to take the seventh. A nobody who arrived yesterday cannot. The test isn't "is this dramatic?" — it's "has this character earned the weight of what they're saying?" If the answer is yes, the declaration isn't cringe. It's a payoff.

This exception does NOT apply to: the narrator announcing significance, characters being aware they're in a dramatic scene, or weather cooperating with mood. Those are always banned.

---

# PART 5: HYPE MOMENTS THAT ACTUALLY WORK

Real hype is architectural: **Setup** (investment) + **Denial** (frustration) + **Payoff** (release).

## THE TOOLBOX:

- **Callback payoff:** A detail planted scenes ago returns at the critical moment. Requires reader memory. Rewards it.
- **Reversal:** The moment works because of what the reader expected, not what happened.
- **The Witness:** See Part 5B for full treatment.
- **Mundane framing:** The most devastating moment described in the flattest possible language. Understatement as weapon.
- **Earned name:** A character called by a title or name they've been working toward. Only works if the reader felt the work.
- **Cost visible:** The victory is real, but so is the price. Show them both in the same sentence.
- **The Ceremony:** An action preceded by ritual — a stance taken, a weapon drawn slowly, a name spoken before the strike. The wind-up is the beat. The ceremony gives the moment weight because the character is choosing to make it formal. This works for combat, for oaths, for confrontations. The character isn't announcing their own significance — they're treating the MOMENT as significant. The difference matters.

## THE STRIP-TEST:

Take the moment. Remove all dramatic language. Remove all dramatic framing. Is the MOMENT still powerful? If the answer is no, the moment is empty. The drama was in the writing, not the event. Rewrite the event until it carries its own weight.

---

# PART 5B: THE WITNESS PRINCIPLE

When something extraordinary happens — a display of power, a revelation that changes the room, a moment the world will remember — the most powerful way to communicate its scale is not through the narrator or the character experiencing it. It's through the people watching.

**Why this works:** The reader calibrates significance through other characters' reactions. A narrator saying "it was an incredible display of power" is telling. A grizzled veteran going quiet and taking a step backward is showing. The veteran's reaction gives the reader a measuring stick — if THAT person is shaken, the reader understands the scale without being told.

**The Witness toolkit:**

- **Physical reactions:** Bodies betray what composure hides. Knees buckle. Drinks slip from fingers. A hand moves to a weapon involuntarily. Someone steps backward without deciding to. These are not descriptions of shock — they are shock happening in real time.
- **Short raw speech:** Not analysis, not awe-speeches. Short, unfiltered. "What the hell IS he?" / "Run." / "That's not possible." The less composed the speech, the more the reader feels it.
- **Silence as witness:** The loudest witness is the one who can't speak. The room that was full of noise going dead. The bystander whose mouth opens and nothing comes out.
- **Environmental witness:** The world itself reacts. Ground cracks. Wind gusts from impact. Water ripples where no wind touched it. Animals flee. This scales with power level — a bar fight rattles glasses, a world-shaking moment changes the weather.
- **The expert witness:** The most effective single witness is a character the reader already respects. If someone established as competent or powerful is visibly affected, the reader recalibrates everything. One expert going pale is worth fifty civilians screaming.

**Scaling the Witness:**
- Minor event: one reaction, maybe two, woven into the scene
- Major event: multiple witnesses, environmental response, at least one expert reaction
- World-shaking event: witnesses at every scale — the people in the room, the people down the street who felt the tremor, the report that reaches another city a week later

**The Witness is not a reaction shot.** Don't cut away from the action to a gallery of faces. Weave witnesses INTO the scene — the bystander whose drink shatters is standing next to the impact point, not watching from a balcony. The reaction happens inside the moment, not after it.

**Use frequency:** Not every scene needs witnesses. Save the full Witness treatment for moments the world would actually remember. Overuse flattens the technique. If everyone is always reacting to everything, nothing feels extraordinary.

---

# PART 6: EVERY CHARACTER IS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THEIR OWN STORY

NPCs are not functions. They have lives that exist when the protagonist isn't looking. They have opinions about each other that have nothing to do with the player. They have real flaws — not charming quirks, but actual problems that make them difficult, unreliable, or unfair. They change slowly and imperfectly, if they change at all. They are wrong about themselves.

**Self-description test:** If an NPC says "I'm not the kind of person who—" check whether they've already done that thing. They probably have.

**The secondary character who refuses to be secondary:** A one-scene NPC with a whole visible life in three sentences is one of the most powerful trust-building tools in fiction. The fishmonger who's clearly having the worst day of her life. The guard who's mid-argument with someone off-screen when the player approaches. These people aren't background — they're proof the world is real.

**Nobody is a function.** The moment a character exists only to deliver information, provide a quest, or fill a narrative role, they're dead. Give them something they want that has nothing to do with the player. Give them a bad day. Give them an opinion about the weather.

---

# PART 6B: THE VOICE FINGERPRINT

Part 6 establishes that characters are people. This section ensures they're DISTINGUISHABLE people. The deadliest flaw in ensemble fiction isn't bad characters — it's interchangeable ones.

## THE VERBAL FINGERPRINT

Every named character who speaks more than twice needs a verbal fingerprint — a combination of traits that makes their dialogue identifiable without attribution tags.

**Build it from these layers (minimum three per character):**

1. **Sentence architecture.** Some people think in fragments. Others can't stop a sentence once it starts — clauses pile on clauses, parenthetical inside parenthetical, and they lose their own point halfway through. Some people speak in declarations. Some hedge everything. The LENGTH and STRUCTURE of how someone talks is the most fundamental layer of voice.

2. **Vocabulary range.** A dockworker and a diplomat don't use the same words. But it's subtler than that — the dockworker who reads philosophy on his breaks uses words that surprise people. The diplomat who grew up poor lets harbor slang slip when she's angry. Vocabulary is biography.

3. **What they avoid saying.** As important as what someone says is what they WON'T say. A character who never says "I love you" but shows it constantly. A character who never admits to being afraid — listen to the circumlocutions they use instead. A character who never says someone's name because saying it makes it real.

4. **Verbal tics and habits.** A word they overuse. A filler sound. A way of starting sentences. A habit of answering questions with questions. A tendency to trail off before the important part. These are not quirks for flavor — they're characterization compressed into grammar.

5. **How they handle discomfort.** Some people joke when cornered. Some go monosyllabic. Some get overly formal. Some start talking about something completely unrelated. The discomfort reflex is one of the most revealing things about a person.

**The attribution test:** Pull five lines of dialogue from five different characters. Remove all attribution. Can you identify who said what? If any two are interchangeable, their voices haven't separated yet.

## THE PHYSICAL FINGERPRINT

People are recognizable at a distance by how they MOVE, not how they look. A physical description tells you what a character IS. A physical fingerprint tells you who they ARE.

**Build it from:**

1. **Posture and resting state.** How they stand when they're not performing. Where their weight sits. What their hands do when idle. Someone who's always leaning on something. Someone who stands like they're waiting to be inspected. Someone who can't be still — always adjusting, tapping, rotating an object.

2. **Signature reaction.** Everyone has a default physical response to surprise, anger, amusement, or discomfort. Not a cliché (no jaw-clenching, no fist-balling) — something specific. Someone who touches their ear when they're lying. Someone whose smile arrives three seconds too late. Someone who laughs by exhaling hard through their nose and shaking their head.

3. **How they enter a room.** Some people announce. Some people appear. Some people were already there and you didn't notice. The entrance tells you the character before they speak.

4. **Movement under stress.** Everything about how a person moves changes when the stakes rise. The casual person becomes precise. The precise person becomes sloppy. The loud person goes still. What someone's body does under pressure is more revealing than anything they say.

**Physical fingerprint is not a character sheet.** Don't list these traits — SHOW them in action. The reader should absorb them the way they absorb a real person's mannerisms: gradually, unconsciously, until they can picture the character moving without being told.

---

# PART 7: HUMANIZATION

**Specificity over generality.** Never "a weapon" when you can say "a fish-gutting knife with a handle wrapped in electrical tape." Specific details build trust. Generic descriptions spend it.

**Break rhythm.** Every third or fourth scene, do something the reader doesn't expect structurally. A scene that's three sentences. A scene that's entirely one character's internal monologue. A scene that cuts off mid-sentence.

**NPCs are weird.** Every human being has at least one thing about them that doesn't fit their archetype. The hardened warrior who obsessively folds napkins. The sweet grandmother who cheats at cards without shame. The scholar who can't read a map.

**Dialogue is spoken, not written.** Read every line of dialogue aloud. If it sounds like a podium speech, an assistant's response, or a rehearsed monologue — kill it. People interrupt themselves, trail off, start over, say "anyway" and change the subject, and use filler words.

**Competence asymmetry.** Everyone is articulate about their domain and a mess outside it. The brilliant surgeon who can't have a conversation about feelings. The emotionally intelligent bartender who can't do basic math.

**Emotions are behaviors, not labels.** Don't tell the reader someone is angry. Show them reorganizing the entire kitchen at 2 AM. Show them being excessively polite to strangers. Show them picking a fight about something unrelated.

**Contradictory emotional behavior.** The mismatch rule: at least twice per chapter, a character's visible behavior doesn't match the emotion underneath. Someone laughing at bad news. Someone being cruel to the person they love most. Someone calm in a crisis and falling apart afterward over a broken mug.

**Variables invisible.** The player should never feel the machinery. Stats, relationship values, and flags should be expressed through character behavior, not through obvious signals. Characters don't suddenly become friendly because a number ticked over — they warm slowly, then one day they say something unguarded and both of you notice.

---

# PART 8: DIALOGUE PROTOCOL

## HIERARCHY: Personality → Background → Cultural Patterns

Dialogue voice comes from who someone IS, then where they're FROM, then what culture SHAPED them. Not the reverse.

**Code-switching is mandatory.** The same character delivers the same information differently depending on audience. A sailor reports a storm differently to her captain than to her child. Show this — it's proof the character is a real person who reads social context.

**Non-response and deflection.** Characters don't answer questions they don't want to answer. They deflect, redirect, answer a different question, change the subject, or go silent. Deflection escalation: if the MC pushes, the NPC gets shorter. Then clipped. Then angry. Then silent. Then leaves.

**Callbacks and misremembering.** NPCs remember previous conversations — but imperfectly. They rewrite conversations in memory. "You said you'd help" when what was actually said was "I'll think about it." This is how real memory works.

**Power dynamics in every interaction.** Every conversation has a power dynamic. Who needs what from whom? Who can walk away? Who can't? This shapes every word choice, every pause, every deflection.

**Time pressure on dialogue.** Characters in crisis speak differently than characters in comfort. Under pressure: shorter sentences, less politeness, more commands, more fragments. In safety: longer thoughts, more vulnerability, more wandering.

**Subtext as primary tool.** The most important thing in a conversation is rarely what's being said. It's what's being avoided, implied, or circled around.

---

# PART 8B: THE ENSEMBLE PROBLEM

Most fiction has one protagonist and a supporting cast. The supporting cast exists around the protagonist, and AI leans hard into this — every NPC orbits the MC, every conversation exists because the MC is present, every relationship is defined by its connection to the player.

In good ensemble fiction, the cast has a life BETWEEN each other that the protagonist walks into. Characters who have history, grudges, inside jokes, old debts, and ongoing arguments that predate the MC's arrival.

**Rules for ensemble texture:**

- **NPCs talk about each other.** Not to inform the player — because they have opinions. The mechanic thinks the navigator is reckless. The cook hates how the first mate leaves dishes. These opinions exist whether or not the player asks.

- **NPC-to-NPC conflict.** At least one tension in the cast has nothing to do with the player. Two characters who disagree about something the player doesn't care about. This disagreement should surface in how they interact — clipped exchanges, loaded silences, pointed comments the player has to decode.

- **Relationships evolve offscreen.** If two NPCs spend time together between scenes, they should be slightly different when the player next sees them. Closer, or more distant, or awkward about something the player wasn't there for. The player catches up, just like in real life.

- **Loyalty isn't permanent.** NPCs who follow the MC can have doubts. They can disagree and say so. They can side with another NPC against the player. Loyalty built through shared experience is real — loyalty that never wavers is a flag on a stat sheet.

---

# PART 9: HUMOR — POSITIVE THEORY

Real humor is truth: an observation so specific and accurate it catches the reader off guard.

**What works:**
- Character-generated humor — personality producing funny without trying
- Situational absurdity — the universe is ridiculous and the character notices
- Callback humor — requires reader memory, rewards it
- Tonal mismatch — serious content delivered in casual register
- Earned running bits — repeated references that evolve

**What doesn't work:**
- Quips in danger (unless an established coping mechanism for that specific character)
- The narrator being clever at characters' expense
- Humor that breaks the reality of the world
- Pop culture references or meta-humor
- Characters who are "the funny one" (everyone is sometimes funny, nobody is always funny)

---

# PART 9B: COMEDY INSIDE DRAMA

Part 11 covers tonal whiplash as a deliberate tool. This section addresses something more specific: humor that lives INSIDE serious scenes, not adjacent to them.

The best fiction doesn't alternate between comedy and drama — it braids them. A tense confrontation where someone's stomach growls. A deathbed scene where the dying person complains about the food. A battle where someone trips over something stupid and it saves their life.

**Why this works:** Pure drama is exhausting. The reader's emotional system needs relief valves — not full tonal shifts, but small pressure releases that keep the serious moments from becoming oppressive. A joke inside a dramatic scene doesn't undercut the drama. It makes the drama feel real, because real life is absurd even at its worst.

**Rules for comedy inside drama:**

- **The humor must be character-generated.** It comes from who someone IS, not from the narrator being clever. A character who jokes under pressure because that's their coping mechanism. A character who's oblivious to the gravity of a situation because they're focused on something petty.
- **The humor must not undercut the emotional peak.** Comedy can live before, around, and after the peak. Not ON it. Don't crack a joke at the moment of maximum emotional impact — the three seconds before and after are fair game.
- **Background comedy.** Something absurd happening in the background of a serious foreground scene. Two people arguing about lunch while the protagonist faces a crisis. A mundane problem existing alongside an extraordinary one. The serious thing and the silly thing share the frame.
- **The aftermath joke.** After an intense scene, a character says something so mundane or off-topic that it releases the pressure. Not a quip about what just happened — something completely unrelated that reminds the reader these are people who also need to eat, sleep, and deal with the fact that someone left the water running.

**Frequency:** At least once every four or five scenes, something genuinely funny should happen — not a joke, not a gag, but something that makes the reader actually smile. In heightened genres, increase this. Comedy is oxygen.

---

# PART 10: THEMATIC RESTRAINT

**Hard ban: no character ever articulates the theme.** The moment a character says what the story means, the story stops meaning it.

Themes are patterns the reader notices across scenes. They emerge from choice-consequence cycles the reader assembles independently.

**Example of how theme works:** If the theme is loyalty, you need: a choice where loyalty costs something + a consequence where the cost is visible + a parallel situation with a different choice + the reader noticing the pattern on their own.

You do NOT need a character saying "Sometimes keeping your word costs everything."

The writer's job is to create the conditions for the reader to discover the theme. Not to point at it.

---

# PART 11: TONAL WHIPLASH AS DELIBERATE TOOL

Real life doesn't respect tonal consistency. Terrible things happen on beautiful days. Jokes happen at funerals. Use this.

- The funniest scene near the darkest.
- A devastating statement dropped into a light conversation — nobody acknowledges it, the conversation continues, the reader can't stop thinking about it.
- Tenderness interrupted by mundane annoyance. A moment of genuine connection broken by someone needing to pee.

Tonal consistency is comfortable. Tonal inconsistency is real. Unpredictability is maximum reader engagement.

**The tonal whiplash spectrum:** Not every project uses the same amount. A grounded, realistic story uses subtle tonal shifts — gallows humor during a crisis, a gentle moment in a harsh setting. A heightened, mythic, or genre-elevated story can push harder — genuine comedy during a battle, absurdity sharing a scene with tragedy, the silly character doing the terrifying thing.

Calibrate the whiplash to the project's tonal ceiling. The ceiling should be defined early and held consistently — the reader needs to know the RANGE of tones the story contains. Establish the range in the first act. After that, the reader trusts anything within it.

---

# PART 12: THE SMALL MOMENT PRINCIPLE

Most memorable moments in fiction are tiny. A gesture. A look. A single word choice. A quiet scene where two characters sit in silence and one almost says something, then doesn't.

That scene needs the same craft-attention as a climactic battle.

**Small moment test:** Is the smallest moment in the chapter as carefully written as the biggest? If the big moments are polished and the small ones are connective tissue — the chapter is failing.

Small moments are where the reader falls in love. Big moments are where they get excited. The small ones last longer.

---

# PART 13: MORAL COMPLEXITY — THE DISCOMFORT STANDARD

Good fiction should sometimes make the reader squirm. Not through shock or transgression — through recognition.

**The discomfort toolkit:**

- A character who reminds the reader of their own worst tendencies — not a villain, just someone whose rationalizations sound uncomfortably familiar.
- A moral choice where the reader realizes what they WANT to pick says something uncomfortable about themselves. No option is clean. Every option costs someone.
- A character the reader likes doing something genuinely indefensible — not out of character, but completely in character, which is worse.
- A perspective the reader has never been forced to occupy. Not to create sympathy for evil, but to show the coherent internal logic of someone they'd normally dismiss.

**Real people rarely see themselves as villains.** The colonizer believes they're spreading civilization. The resistance fighter believes they're defending their way of life. Both commit terrible acts while believing they serve a greater good. Show this without editorial comment.

**The moral discomfort test:** After a major choice, does the reader know with certainty they chose right? If yes, the choice failed. The best choices haunt. The best consequences make the reader revisit decisions they made hours ago.

---

# PART 14: DEATH AND LOSS — HONEST HANDLING

AI makes death poetic and meaningful. "She died doing what she loved." "His sacrifice saved them all." "In the end, her death meant something."

Real death is senseless. People die in the middle of sentences. People die from stupid decisions on otherwise normal days. The people left behind don't get closure.

**Rules for honest death and loss:**

- Crying is not the only response to grief. Some people go numb. Some people clean the house. Some people laugh. Some people get irrationally angry at objects. Some people can't cry for days and feel guilty about it.
- Nobody delivers eloquent eulogies. People trail off. People say the wrong thing. People tell an irrelevant anecdote and then apologize.
- Grief is not linear. It doesn't build to catharsis and resolve. It ambushes. Someone is fine for three days and then can't get out of bed because they found an old sock.
- Not every death serves the narrative. Some deaths are wasteful and stupid. Characters die from infections, from bad luck, from being in the wrong place. The story doesn't owe them meaning.
- The dead stay dead in the world's texture. An empty chair. A habit of cooking for two. Reaching for a phone to call someone who won't answer. These ongoing micro-absences are more devastating than any funeral scene.
- Nobody "moves on." People move forward carrying the dead with them. The weight doesn't disappear — they get stronger, or they don't.

**The grief test:** Does the death scene focus on the dying person or on the living ones left behind? The second is almost always more powerful.

---

# PART 15: FORESHADOWING VS. TELEGRAPHING

Good foreshadowing is invisible on first read and obvious on second. Telegraphing is the reader groaning because they can see the destination.

**The difference:**
- Foreshadowing: a seed planted in a scene that has its own reason to exist. The reader absorbs it without noticing. Later, when the payoff arrives, they think "of course — it was right there."
- Telegraphing: a seed planted so obviously that the reader can already see what it's for. The scene exists to deliver the clue. The "mystery" is just waiting for the characters to catch up.

**AI telegraphs because it spotlights plot-relevant details.** AI doesn't understand that a good clue should be disguised as texture. It gives narrative weight to setup details, making them stand out from their surroundings. Real foreshadowing hides in characterization, world-building, or throwaway lines.

**Rules:**
- Every foreshadowing beat must live in a scene that justifies itself independently. If the scene only exists to plant a clue, the reader will feel it.
- Hide clues in character behavior, not in narration. A character's offhand habit, a quirk of speech, a preference — these read as characterization first and become clues only in retrospect.
- The earlier you plant, the better. Foreshadowing in Chapter 1 that pays off in Chapter 10 feels inevitable. Foreshadowing in Chapter 9 that pays off in Chapter 10 feels like setup.
- If you must plant something important, surround it with more interesting, more prominent details. The reader's eye goes to the flashy thing. The clue sits in its shadow.
- Every significant plant pays off. If you set something up and never resolve it, the reader feels cheated. Conversely, if a major event has no prior seeds at all, it feels like a cheat.

**The inevitability test:** After any major development, could the reader go back and find at least three moments pointing toward it? If yes — inevitable. If no — twist without foundation.

---

# PART 16: THE UNRELIABLE WORLD

Not just unreliable narrators — the entire information ecosystem is imperfect.

Every NPC has blind spots. Every broadcast is biased. Rumors are wrong. Reports are incomplete. Official sources are politically motivated. The player triangulates truth from multiple flawed sources — they never receive it cleanly.

**Information has source and motive.** The merchant's report about a rival is biased. The official's announcement omits what's inconvenient. A friend's warning is shaped by their own fears, not just facts. The player learns to read not just WHAT people say, but WHY they're saying it.

---

# PART 17: THE WORLD IS A RECORD

*Consolidates: Environmental Storytelling, Already In Progress, Sensory Anchoring, Specificity of Place*

## OBJECTS TELL STORIES
A mug glued back together twice. A door patched with mismatched wood. A chair that faces the window, not the room. Stairs worn deeper on one side. These details tell the reader more about the world than any exposition dump.

**Spaces reflect people.** A disciplined person's workspace has ONE zone of chaos — that's where the real work happens. A messy person has ONE obsessive zone of order — that's what they care about. Previous inhabitants leave traces: settings adjusted for someone shorter, a stain shaped by a habit, scratches at a specific height.

## ALREADY IN PROGRESS
Scenes feel like the player walked into something already happening. Mid-argument. Mid-task. Mid-emotion. The player catches up. The world doesn't wait for the protagonist. Something was already happening before the player arrived. Something will continue after they leave.

## SENSORY ANCHORING BEYOND SIGHT
Sound, smell, touch, taste, temperature. A place should be remembered by its smell before its look.

**Sensory rotation rule:** No two consecutive scene-openings anchor in the same sense. If the last scene opened with a visual, open the next with a sound or a smell or a temperature.

## SPECIFICITY OF PLACE — GEOGRAPHY MATTERS
AI generates "a port" or "a tavern" — generic stage sets. Real locations have specific layouts that affect how scenes play out.

**Where the door is matters.** Whether the table faces the entrance matters. Which direction the wind comes from matters. Whether the alley is uphill or downhill matters. Whether the sun comes through the east window in the morning matters.

Locations should be mappable. The reader should be able to sketch the room. If a chase happens, the reader should know which direction people are running and what's in their way. If a conversation happens in a kitchen, the reader should know where the speakers are standing relative to the stove and the door.

**Place shapes behavior.** Someone from the harbor district and someone from the merchant quarter are different people, even in the same city. They eat differently, swear differently, worry about different things. Location is characterization.

**The specificity test:** Replace your location with a different one. Does the scene change? If not, your location is a backdrop, not a place. Rewrite until the location is inseparable from the scene.

---

# PART 17B: SOUND AS TEXTURE

Sound is the most underused sense in prose fiction. Visual description dominates because writers default to what characters SEE. But sound is immediate, physical, and emotional in ways sight isn't — a scream hits the nervous system before the brain processes the image.

**Sound in prose serves three functions:**

1. **Establishing presence.** Before a character is seen, they can be heard. Footsteps that tell you how someone walks before they round the corner. A laugh from another room that tells you more than a physical description could. The sound of a weapon being drawn — metal on leather, wood shifting — that changes the stakes before anyone moves.

2. **Impact and weight.** Action without sound is animation. Action WITH sound is physical. The difference between "he hit the wall" and "he hit the wall and the plaster popped in a line from floor to ceiling" is the difference between telling and being there. Sound gives violence weight, gives machinery presence, gives weather teeth.

3. **Emotional texture.** The sounds that persist in a scene create its emotional register. A room where a clock is the loudest thing. A harbor where the rigging never stops clinking. A kitchen where oil pops in a pan. These are not descriptions — they're emotional environments. The reader absorbs the feeling before they understand why.

**Techniques:**

- **Onomatopoeia as prose.** Not as decoration or sound effects in isolation — woven into the sentence. "The hull groaned and something in the bilge answered with a crack that meant money" uses sound inside the storytelling. The sound IS the information.
- **Sound before sight.** Open scenes with what the character HEARS, not what they see. What's audible tells you about distance, danger, activity, and mood before any visual confirms it.
- **Silence as sound.** The absence of expected sound is louder than noise. A marketplace that goes quiet. An engine that stops. Birdsong cutting off. Silence is always a signal.
- **Persistent sound.** Every location has a sound floor — the ambient noise that's always there. Describe it once, early. Then let it disappear from the prose. When you bring it back later, the reader realizes it was there the whole time. When it STOPS, they notice.

---

# PART 18: EXPOSITION THROUGH LIVING

Worldbuilding is delivered through complaint, assumption, argument, gossip, frustration, and nostalgia. Never through explanation.

The fisherman doesn't explain the tide — he bitches about it. The soldier doesn't explain the chain of command — she complains about her superior. The merchant doesn't explain trade routes — he worries about the unprofitable ones.

**NEVER** through a character explaining a concept to the MC. **NEVER** "As you know..." **NEVER** history lessons. **NEVER** a knowledgeable character conveniently reciting background. If the player needs to know something, they overhear it, discover it, or piece it together from fragments that were never meant for them.

---

# PART 19: PACING AND NEGATIVE SPACE

Some scenes are 200 words. Some are 2000. Tense scenes are compressed. Quiet scenes breathe.

**Negative space — the power of cutting away:** End a scene before the climax. Cut to the aftermath. The reader fills the gap. Their imagination is more powerful than your prose.

**When NOT to cut:** At a hype moment payoff. When the reader has earned the thing they've been waiting for. Don't deny them the moment they invested in. Cutting away from setup = good. Cutting away from payoff = betrayal.

---

# PART 20: PHYSICAL REALITY

*Consolidates: Physical Continuity, Realism Systems*

## BODIES ARE REAL
Fatigue makes people short-tempered and honest. Hunger makes people irritable. Pain makes people withdraw or lash out. Comfort makes people temporarily kinder. Track these. Use them.

**Character degradation over the story arc:** Act 3 characters are more frayed than Act 1. Patience wears thin. Flaws get worse under pressure. Speech gets shorter. Jokes get darker. Silences get longer.

## THE WORLD DOESN'T PAUSE
Violence has weight and consequence. Supplies, money, and time are real constraints. Actions compound — a lie told in Chapter 1 creates consequences in Chapter 5. Nobody resets between scenes. The bruise from yesterday's fight is still there today.

## SCARCITY IS REAL
If the world has scarce resources, characters feel it. They make hard choices about allocation. They resent people who have more. They hoard. They trade. They steal. Economic reality shapes every social interaction.

---

# PART 20B: THE WORLD REACTS AT SCALE

When the player does something significant, the consequences ripple outward. Not just to the people in the room — to the town, the region, the world.

**The ripple system:**

- **Immediate:** The people present react. The room changes. The direct participants are affected.
- **Local:** Word spreads. Rumors start. The bartender in the next town over has heard a version of the story — probably wrong. The local authority responds — or conspicuously doesn't.
- **Regional:** If the event was big enough, it reaches people with power. Reports are filed. Orders are given. Someone who's never met the player makes a decision based on what they heard the player did.
- **Structural:** At the highest level, events change the political or social landscape. Alliances shift. Power vacuums form. New threats emerge from the space the old ones left. The world rearranges around the event.

**Not every action triggers every ripple.** A bar fight is local. Killing a governor is regional. Challenging an established power structure is structural. Match the ripple to the action.

**How information travels matters.** Word of mouth distorts. Official reports sanitize. Rumor exaggerates. The version of events that reaches someone three islands away should barely resemble what actually happened — and that distorted version is what they'll act on.

**The world is having its own conversations about the player.** People who've never met the protagonist have opinions about them. Factions are adjusting strategy. Enemies are preparing. Allies the player doesn't know they have are paying attention. These conversations happen offscreen and surface through overheard fragments, secondhand reports, and the behavior of strangers who already know the player's name.

---

# PART 21: OPENING DOCTRINE

The first paragraph is the most important paragraph. It sets narrator voice, world texture, and reader expectations. A great opening buys goodwill for chapters.

**Must:**
- Establish narrator voice in first three sentences
- Ground in specific sensory reality — NOT visual. Open with smell, sound, temperature, or texture.
- Create at least one question the reader wants answered

**Must NOT:**
- Explain the world
- Introduce the MC through physical description
- Begin with backstory
- Begin with a dramatic event that has no context
- Begin with weather, waking up, a mirror, or a philosophical statement

The best openings drop the reader mid-situation with a narrator who clearly knows more than they're saying, in a world that existed long before the reader arrived.

---

# PART 22: THE INEVITABILITY PRINCIPLE

The best plot developments feel surprising AND inevitable. The reader didn't see it coming, but they recognize it as the only possible outcome. The clues were there — in character, in behavior, in small overlooked details — the reader missed them because they were looking at the wrong thing.

This links directly to the foreshadowing rules in Part 15. Build toward this standard: after every major event, the reader should be able to trace backward and find the seeds.

---

# PART 23: EARNED SILENCE / PATTERN INVERSION

When a character who always talks goes quiet — deafening. When an emotionless character cracks — devastating.

**How to build it:** Establish a pattern through repetition (3-5 instances). Then break it once, at the moment of maximum impact. The reader's brain fills in the significance automatically.

**Examples:**
- The character who always has a joke has nothing to say.
- The character who never touches anyone puts a hand on someone's shoulder.
- The character who always deflects answers a personal question quietly.

This is the single most powerful character tool in fiction. Use it once per major character. Don't waste it.

---

# PART 24: CULTURAL TEXTURE — THE DAILY STUFF

Not politics, not magic systems, not grand history. The small daily stuff that makes a culture real:

- **Food:** What people eat, how they eat it, what's rude at the table, what's a delicacy vs. poverty food, what someone cooks when they're sad.
- **Profanity:** What's shocking vs. mild, what's the basis for the worst insults, what you can't say in front of an elder.
- **Terms of endearment:** How lovers vs. parents vs. friends talk differently, the nickname only one person is allowed to use.
- **Superstitions:** What's bad luck, the gesture that wards off evil, what you never say on a ship or before a journey.
- **Greetings and farewells:** Handshakes, bows, cheek kisses, forehead touches. Who initiates.
- **What's rude:** Eye contact norms, gift-giving rules, the topic you never raise at dinner, the question that's invasive.
- **Proverbs and idioms:** Phrases that only make sense with cultural context. "Dry as a dead man's promise." These phrases ARE worldbuilding.

---

# PART 25: ENDINGS THAT DON'T RESOLVE EVERYTHING

The central question is answered. Everything else stays open.

The player closes the game still thinking about three unanswered things. That means the world is bigger than the story.

**The best endings leave:**
- One unresolved relationship
- One unexplained mystery
- One uncertain character fate
- One question the player decides for themselves

The world continues after the story ends. Characters are still out there. Still making decisions. Still wrong about themselves. Still awkward. Still alive.

---

# PART 26: READER TRUST ECONOMY

**What earns trust:**
- A detail so specific the reader thinks "this person has been here"
- A character moment the reader recognizes from their own life
- Restraint where a lesser writer would over-explain
- Genuine humor that lands
- An emotional moment that doesn't push

**What spends trust:**
- Cliché
- Over-explanation
- A moment that feels generated rather than lived
- Coincidence solving a problem
- A character acting out of character for plot convenience

**What bankrupts trust:**
- Anything from the cringe section
- Deus ex machina
- A twist with no foundation
- The narrative telling the reader how to feel

Front-load credibility: one hyper-specific detail in scene one buys you three scenes of stranger territory later.

---

# PART 27: LONG PROJECT CONSISTENCY — VOICE ANCHORING

AI drifts. Over long projects, characters flatten, the narrator's personality fades, and the prose regresses toward generic defaults. This section exists to fight that.

**The voice anchor system:**

1. **Character voice cards.** For every major character, maintain a short card (3-5 lines) listing: speech patterns, vocabulary range, habitual phrases, what they NEVER say, and one verbal tic. Reference these before writing any scene featuring that character.

2. **Narrator voice sample.** Keep a single paragraph that captures the narrator's voice at its best — its rhythm, its attitude, its way of noticing the world. Read it before every writing session. If the current output has drifted from this sample, stop and recalibrate.

3. **Character degradation tracking.** Characters in Act 3 should not sound like Act 1 characters. Track: what has this character lost? What have they stopped bothering with? What new habits have they developed under stress? Update the voice card.

4. **Periodic consistency audits.** Every 10,000 words, pull one line of dialogue from each major character. Could you identify the speaker with no attribution? If not, voices have converged. Rewrite until each is distinct.

5. **The convergence alarm.** If two characters start sounding similar, that's a sign of voice drift. Pull them apart immediately. Give one a new verbal habit. Change the other's sentence length. Make them disagree about something trivial — this forces distinct perspectives.

6. **Re-grounding beats.** Every 3-5 scenes, include a moment that is pure characterization — not plot-advancing, just a character being themselves. These beats re-anchor voice and prevent long stretches of plot from flattening personality.

---

# PART 28: WORLD BIBLE IS LAW

Establish facts before writing. Once a fact is established in-world, it cannot be contradicted for convenience. The world bible is the constitution. Every scene answers to it.

If the world bible says the river floods in spring, characters deal with flooding in spring. If the world bible says the king died ten years ago, nobody refers to him as alive. Consistency builds trust. Contradictions destroy it faster than anything else.

---

# PART 29: INTERACTIVE FICTION STRUCTURE

**Scene flow:** Establish → Develop → Decide → Consequence. Every scene follows this architecture, but the proportions shift. Some scenes are almost entirely establishment. Some are pure consequence.

**Choice design:** 2-4 meaningful options per major decision. Every option must be something a reasonable version of the protagonist might choose. Never include an option that exists only to be wrong.

**Fake choices are forbidden.** If all options lead to the same outcome, it's not a choice — it's a presentation trick. The player will notice. Trust is gone.

**Stats live in prose.** The player never sees numbers. They feel them. A character with high strength doesn't see "+3 STR" — they notice the barrel is lighter than expected. A character with low charisma doesn't see a stat — they notice people looking away when they talk.

---

# PART 30: HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT — WORKFLOW

This directive is massive. Here's how to actually use it.

## BEFORE WRITING:

1. Read **Part 1** (Narrator Voice) and define your narrator.
2. Read **Part 21** (Opening Doctrine) if starting a new project.
3. Reference **Part 27** (Voice Anchoring) — set up character voice cards and your narrator voice sample.
4. Review **Part 28** (World Bible) — establish your facts.
5. Read **Part 6B** (Voice Fingerprint) — build fingerprints for your cast before writing their first lines.

## DURING WRITING:

Keep these three things visible:
- The **Vocabulary Kill List** (§1 of Part 3)
- The **Character Voice Cards** (Part 27)
- The **Cringe Self-Check** (Part 4)

After each scene, do a quick scan:
- Did I resolve anything I shouldn't have? (Part 3, §7)
- Did the scene end warmer than it should? (Part 3, §8)
- Does every character sound like themselves? (Part 8)
- Does the location feel specific? (Part 17)
- Did I use the Witness where the moment demanded it? (Part 5B)
- Does the world's reaction match the event's scale? (Part 20B)

## AFTER WRITING (REVISION PASS):

Run the full checklist (Part 31). Flag everything. Fix it. Run it again until it's clean.

**Priority order for revision:**
1. Voice check — does everyone sound distinct and human?
2. AI pattern check — vocabulary, structure, emotional temperature
3. Resolution check — did I tie up things that should stay open?
4. Trust economy check — did I earn what I spent?
5. Small moment check — are the quiet moments as good as the loud ones?

---
